### üß† What is CasualLite?

**CasualLite** (coded as RCSE-IBFS) is a **fast, interpretable causal discovery algorithm** created by GENESIS. It builds causal skeletons from tabular datasets using independence-based and scoring-based mechanisms.

This repository is a **proof-of-concept** to demonstrate the reasoning, architecture design, and implementation capabilities of GENESIS.

We are proud to announce that CasualLite is the first public algorithm from **Project GENESIS** under the banner of **theAiAlgoRepository**.

### ü§ñ Built by GENESIS: What does that mean?

**Project GENESIS** is an AI research system capable of autonomously producing original machine learning algorithms ‚Äî from concept to functional code ‚Äî without human programming.  
For CasualLite, GENESIS handled the full research and development lifecycle, delivering the final implementation in **50 seconds**.

Human involvement in code creation: *zero*.

### ‚öôÔ∏è CasualLite Highlights

* Zero black-box dependencies  
* Causal skeleton recovery in seconds  
* Scales to datasets with 10‚Äì50+ variables  
* Minimal GPUs or tuning required  
* Outputs adjacency matrix and visual graphs

### üß™ Usage

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
from casuallite import RCSE_IBFS, plot_graph
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset
    df = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
    df['sex'] = df['sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})
    df['embarked'] = df['embarked'].astype('category').cat.codes  
    df['class'] = df['class'].astype('category').cat.codes
    df['who'] = df['who'].astype('category').cat.codes
    df['deck'] = df['deck'].astype('category').cat.codes
    df['alive'] = df['alive'].map({'no': 0, 'yes': 1})
    df['adult_male'] = df['adult_male'].astype(int)
    df['alone'] = df['alone'].astype(int)
    df = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).dropna()

    X_data = df.to_numpy()
    feature_names = df.columns.tolist()

    print("\nüöÄ Running RCSE-IBFS...")
    # Correctly unpack the two return values
    G, importances = RCSE_IBFS(X_data, beta=0.9, alpha_init=0.15, max_cond_set_size=2, feature_names=feature_names)

    print("\nüìå Recovered Causal Skeleton:")
    if G and G.nodes():
        for node in G.nodes():
            print(f"{feature_names[node]}: {[feature_names[n] for n in G.neighbors(node)]}")
        # Pass the importances dictionary to the plotting function
        plot_graph(G, labels=feature_names, title="Titanic Causal Skeleton (RCSE-IBFS)", node_importance=importances)
    else:
        
        print("No causal edges discovered.")

```
### üß≠ Why This Matters

This marks a turning point:
CasualLite is **one of the first fully AI-generated causal discovery algorithms** released to the public.

This isn‚Äôt AutoML.
This is **AutoScience** ‚Äî the beginning of AI engines performing real scientific work.
